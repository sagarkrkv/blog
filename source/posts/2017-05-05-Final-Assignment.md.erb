During this semester I have worked on 3 topics

  * [Cloud Agnostic Load Balancing](https://sagarkrkv.github.io/CI-CD/).
  * [Evalution of Ansible as an infrastructure provisioning tool](https://sagarkrkv.github.io/Assignment-3/).
  * [Cloud Agnostic Continuos Integration / Continuous delivery](https://sagarkrkv.github.io/Assignment-1-2/).

My contributions on each of these problems can be found in my blog entries at
